2. How would you select a new laptop or PC if you were buying one?
   
(Gaming, Graphic designer, Video editing, physics simulation ...)
When selecting a laptop or PC, itâ€™s important to consider the specific needs of the user and choose components that align with their tasks.

For gaming, a powerful graphics card paired with a fast, multi-core processor is essential for handling modern games smoothly. At least 16GB of RAM is recommended, along with a fast SSD for quicker load times. A high-refresh-rate display (120Hz or more) ensures smooth visuals, and effective cooling helps maintain performance during long gaming sessions.

For graphic design, a high-resolution display (2K or 4K) with accurate color reproduction is key. A multi-core processor, 16GB or more of RAM, and a capable graphics card will support demanding design software. Fast storage, such as a 1TB SSD, ensures the user can handle large design files without lag.

For video editing, a processor with multiple cores speeds up rendering and encoding, while a strong graphics card aids in GPU-accelerated tasks. At least 32GB of RAM is recommended for smooth editing, along with a fast SSD (1TB or more) for efficient file access. A 4K display with high color accuracy is crucial for precise editing.

For physics simulations and programming, a high-performance processor with many cores handles complex computations efficiently. At least 32GB of RAM is ideal, and a capable graphics card may be necessary for GPU-accelerated tasks. Fast, large-capacity storage ensures that data-intensive work is managed smoothly.

By focusing on these components, the user can choose a system tailored to their needs, avoiding unnecessary features while ensuring optimal performance.
