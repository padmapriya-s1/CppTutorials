# Implementation and Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

1. Implement Sorting Algorithms:
  Develop implementations for the following sorting algorithms:
  (a) Selection Sort
  (b) Insertion Sort
  (c) Merge Sort

2. Measure Execution Time:
   Record the execution time of each sorting algorithm for varying input sizes.
   Take average execution time for mulitple inputs for an input size.

3. Compare Experimental and Theoretical Performance:
   Analyze the experimentally obtained execution times and compare them with the
   theoretical time complexity estimates for each algorithm.
In theory selection sort and insertion Sort have order n^2 complexity and merge sort is order nlogn. This can be seen in experimental result as well.

4. Determine Input Size Limits:
   Calculate the theoretical maximum input size each algorithm can handle within
    a 5-minute execution time limit.


5. Identify Complexity Expressions:
   Derive the time complexity expressions for each algorithm based on the experimental data
   and compare them with their theoretical counterparts.
   From the graph and by doing least square fit we can see that selection sort and insertion sort are of order n^2. Where as merge sort is nlogn.
