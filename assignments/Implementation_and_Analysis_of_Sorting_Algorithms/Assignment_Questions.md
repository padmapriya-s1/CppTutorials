# Implementation and Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

1. Implement Sorting Algorithms:
  Develop implementations for the following sorting algorithms:
  (a) Selection Sort
  (b) Insertion Sort
  (c) Merge Sort

2. Measure Execution Time:
   Record the execution time of each sorting algorithm for varying input sizes.
   Take average execution time for mulitple inputs for an input size.

3. Compare Experimental and Theoretical Performance:
   Analyze the experimentally obtained execution times and compare them with the
   theoretical time complexity estimates for each algorithm.

4. Determine Input Size Limits:
   Calculate the theoretical maximum input size each algorithm can handle within
    a 5-minute execution time limit.

5. Identify Complexity Expressions:
   Derive the time complexity expressions for each algorithm based on the experimental data
   and compare them with their theoretical counterparts.
